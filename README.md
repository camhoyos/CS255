Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was a company called DriverPass, the owner was Liam. They wanted a system that would support educating people before visiting the DMV. Liam believes that there is an educational gap between when students first are on their path to learn driving and then when they take the DMV exam. They want a system that would support organizing educational sessions between customers (students) and drivers (instructors). There were three different package offerings ranging from in-person education to online documentation. The system would be responsible for scheduling the in-person lessons and making the online documentation available depending on the package purchased.

What did you do particularly well?
I think what I did particularly well is defining where gaps exist based on the client interview. This namely comes from some people I work with professionally about how deep questions need to go around functionality, scope, and expectations. Because of this, it would expected to have follow up discussions with the client to prevent miscommunication in the delivery of a feature.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I know for a fact I could be more detail oriented in all of the UML diagrams. Given the time, I would make every function available in the class diagram, and verify that each of the UML activity/sequence diagram accounted for all proper interactions, roles, and objects.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the needs through the BRD. Effectively each bullet in the 'Objective and Goals' section would need to be accounted for. The idea would be that each of these items would be associated to a user story to verify it is built. In this, the scope could also be signed based on this section. Everything defined would be deliver and would avoid a potential lawsuit. It is important to consider users' needs when designing because that's the purpose of the product to begin with; to provide software to a user in which it makes their life better. In this, you create a service that will continue to generate revenue that can continuously be built upon.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I am an advocate of documentation such as BRDs and system design documents. It really does hone in on what scope is to make sure there are boundaries. Without these boundaries, any client can simply ask for more and without proper documentation to act as the boundary, the request can't effectively be rejected without friction. By having a shared language in a BRD/SOW it would ensure the proper request is delivered.
